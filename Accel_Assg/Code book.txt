tidySet.txt contains a data frame containing 180 observations of 68 variables derived from the Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors . More information on the experiment is available at  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The raw datasets used in creating the tidy dataset can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The variables in tidySet were derived by extracting only mean and standard deviation measures for a set of measured parameters and averaging them out for each subject and each activity type. Thus each observation (row) in the data frame is a set of 66 averaged parameters, specific for a particular activity type (denoted by "ActivityType"), for a particular individual (denoted by "SubjectID"). 33 of these parameters are means of mean measures, while another 33 are means of standard deviation measures. 

The variable names and descriptions in the tidy dataset  are: 

1. SubjectID - A factor indicating the subject identification number (ranging from 1 to 30). Each SubjectID occurs six times in the data frame, once for each activity type
2. ActivityType - A factor indicating the type of activity during which the parameter was measured. There are 6 levels, each repeating 30 times in the data frame, once for each subject. The levels are as follows: "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", "LAYING"
